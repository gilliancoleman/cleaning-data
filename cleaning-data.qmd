Today's exercise you will take data entered into excel from a mangrove propagule growth experiment and write a function to clean the data and prepare it for analysis. This is a common task you could be given as we will often be given a spreadsheet from an experiment. Often there are errors, typos, wrong data types that need to be carefully dealt with prior to analyzing the data.

**Experimental Design:**

2 Locations
3 Treatments (Control, Treatment 1, Treatment 2)
25 Propagules in each Location/Treatment block

Measure the propagule height for the 25 propagules (repeated measures of same propagule) once a week for 6 months

**The Function will:**

1.  read in data from an excel spreadsheet (found in the /data directory)

2.  return a dataframe that is ready for analysis

Hints: inspect the data first and come up with a plan

**Bonus Exercise**

Create another function that plots the growth over time for each Location by Treatment type
